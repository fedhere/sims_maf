# Notes to help build on mac (since makefile has permissions problems)

# if you need to build the API documentation
sphinx-apidoc -o source -f -H "lsst.sims.maf" ../python/
(and be sure to cd doc; python metricList.py while sims_maf_contrib is set up, to build metricList.rst)

# to just build the sphinx documentation html files
sphinx-build -b html source ./html
